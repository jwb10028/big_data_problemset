So , we expect the children to be indoors as much as possible . Once the children are out on the streets selling , then the President 's drive against the coronavirus is defeated because the children become exposed . We know it is going to be difficult for some of the parents . But the end results will be of immense benefit to all of us , \" the MCE had said . <p> Minutes after the arrests , scores of parents trooped to the two holding centers and pleaded for clemency for their wards . <p> In an interview with 3news.com , Public Relations Officer of STMA John Laste said particulars of the children who were arrested and their parents were taken and were cautioned before release . <p> \" What we told the parents is that if their children are arrested for the second time , they will be arraigned before court . A good number of them pleaded and said they will take the warning serious . The team will continue the operation on Tuesday at the other markets within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of compliance , \" he said <p> He added that the team will also ensure enforcement of directives on public gatherings , closure of beaches , provision of handwashing facilities and compliance of social distance at the banks , restaurants , transport terminals and

      "|@@31754641 <p> The Colombo Stock Exchange ( CSE ) has continued to receive inquiries pertaining to the hosting of Annual General Meetings ( AGMs ) and requesting guidance to comply with the mandatory requirement within the boundaries of an excepted framework in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic . Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 via its participants and introduce the virus to new communities . Given the public health and safety concerns related to COVID-19 , the CSE in its continued efforts to promote social distancing and discourage public gatherings has offered guidance to assist Listed Companies in meeting their obligation of hosting an AGM . <p> The Listing Rules of the CSE do not contain specific provisions relating to the date on which an AGM is to be hosted by a listed company . As such , listed companies will be required to comply with the applicable provisions set out in the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 ( ' Companies Act ' ) and the Articles of Association of the company in this regard . <p> This interim guidance is intended to act as a guideline for companies listed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in hosting AGMs amidst the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic . The guidance offered is purely for information purposes and should be construed only as a guide . It is imperative that a listed company obtain appropriate legal advice in determining the most appropriate arrangement regarding the conduct of an AGM in the current context . <p> The following measures/factors can be considered by listed companies in this regard : <p> Postponement of the AGM <p> The company could decide to postpone its scheduled/to be scheduled AGM awaiting a more conducive environment to surface . A listed company that has already scheduled and disclosed its AGM is required to notify the CSE of its postponement . Preferably , this notice may be published in the newspapers as well . <p> The payment of a final dividend , already announced by a listed company and is in requirement of the approval of its shareholders , would also be postponed accordingly . The company could also decide to pay an interim dividend instead of the announced final dividend provided adequate prior notice can be given to the market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could choose electronic means ( subject to legal advice ) to serve notices and other communications regarding the AGM to its shareholders . <p> Any postponement of the AGM will be subject to the timelines specified in Section 133 of the Companies Act and if unable to comply , the company is advised to consult the Registrar General of Companies for further guidance . <p> Virtual AGMs <p> Companies listed on the CSE have also been presented with the option of hosting its AGM virtually to comply with the regulatory requirements and restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic . This may include electronic and teleconference mechanisms to host the AGM such as Facebook Live , WEB Ex , Zoom , Webinar . <p> A company could choose to explore this alternate avenue unless restricted by its Articles of Association and subject to legal advice . The company may also consider the options set out in Section 144 of the Companies Act , under legal advice . <p> Hybrid AGMs <p> The guidance offered by CSE also presents the option for a listed company to organize and host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be simultaneously held at a physical and virtual location would enable a listed company to conduct its AGM with minimal physical presence which would mitigate the risk factor associated with the spread of the virus . <p> If the Notice of Meeting has already been dispatched to the shareholders , it may be advisable to issue a Supplementary Notice , setting out the instructions . The company is obligated to notify the CSE with regards to the decision made which would be disseminated to the market . <p> Vote by Proxy <p> A listed company may also offer its shareholders an option to vote by proxy in the Notice of Meeting . In such instances , the shareholders could be presented with the option of authorizing an independent director to attend and vote at the AGM on their behalf . <p> Questions by shareholders prior to the AGM <p> A listed company may accommodate questions by its shareholders related to the business of the AGM which could be submitted prior to the date of the AGM . Responses to these provided by the Board of Directors and management along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of the AGM . <p> Alternative arrangements for venues to facilitate the AGM <p> A listed company could also choose to host its AGM segregating its shareholders across a number of venues and enabling video links connecting its shareholders to the meeting . This option would reduce the numbers present at a single location which would aid the company and its shareholders to adhere to guidelines in relation to preventing the spread COVID-19 . <p> The company may be required to provide a notice of this adaptation in advance to its shareholders , specifying the numbers accommodated at a single venue and requesting shareholders to pre-register themselves or their proxies for arrangements to be made accordingly . <p> Additionally , the company could also have in place temperature and health screening measures , allowing them to turn away shareholders who fail to satisfy the health screen measures .

The 1918-1919 flu pandemic killed 675,000 in the United States , according to the CDC . <p> New York state remained the epicenter of the outbreak , accounting for more than a third of the US deaths .

at 20 hotels , which have lost most of their guests as travel has stopped . <p> \" This is going to be an epic process during the month of April to build out all that capacity , \" de Blasio said . \" But this goal can be reached . \" <p> California saw the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more than 8000 as Governor Gavin Newsom warned that even as stay-at-home policies appeared to be having some effect , the state would run out of intensive- care hospital beds equipped with ventilators within six weeks . <p> Newsom said California could still manage to \" bend \" the state 's infection curve more , saving the need for additional beds , if residents were rigorous in staying home and avoiding contact with others . <p> \" We are in a completely different place than the state of New York and I hope we will continue to be , but we wo n't unless people continue to practice physical distancing and do their part , \" the Democratic governor told a news conference in the state capital ,

Ron DeSantis told Fox News that Broward County would likely allow two cruise ships with coronavirus outbreaks carrying a total of 2,500 people to dock in Fort Lauderdale , despite his misgivings about potentially contagious foreign nationals . <p> \" We were concerned about a deluge into the hospitals , but I think it turns out that there will probably be some who need to go , but it 's very

      "|@@31755241 <h> The Virus Is a Reminder of Something Lost Long Ago <p> Editor 's Note:The Atlantic is making vital coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers . Find the collection here . <p> Around the year 1600 , the weather in much of Europe substantially cooled , in the latter phase of what has been called the Little Ice Age . In all , it lasted 300 years . Winters were brutally cold and summers were damp and chilly , greatly curtailing the growing season . Crops failed . People starved . But the change in weather forced English , French , and Dutch fishermen to build improved boats , capable of following fish farther to the west and surviving long trips through the rough seas . Undoubtedly , some of that new boat-building craft led to the ships of today . <p> Innovation often arises in periods of adversity . In recent weeks , we have seen such welcome invention germinating in the horrendous crisis of the coronavirus . Consider , for example , the many new platforms for online teaching , or the use of cheap Bluetooth smart thermometers able to transmit a person 's fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toronto Symphony Orchestra performing together and apart from 29 different locations using their smartphones . <p> In bad times , innovation can occur in habits of mind as well as in new technologies . The frightening COVID-19 pandemic may be creating such a change now -- by forcing many of us to slow down , to spend more time in personal reflection , away from the noise and heave of the world . With more quiet time , more privacy , more stillness , we have an opportunity to think about who we are , as individuals and as a society . <p> Habits of mind and lifestyle do not change easily . Without noticing , we slowly slip into the routines of our lives , like becoming so accustomed to living on a noisy street that we can not remember our previous neighborhood and a time of silence . Some powerful force must strike to awaken us from our slumber . Now we have been struck . We have a chance to notice : We have been living too fast . We have sold our inner selves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" progress . \" <p> Since the Industrial Revolution , the pace of life has been driven by the speed of commerce and business . And the speed of business , in turn , has been driven by the speed of communication . In the 1830s , the fast , new communication device was the telegraph , which could relay information at about 3 bits a second . That speed rose to about 1,000 bits a second in the mid-1980s with the advent of the internet . Today , the rate is 1,000,000,000 bits a second . The resulting increase in productivity in the workplace , coupled with the time-equals-money equation , has led to our acute awareness of the commercial and goal-oriented uses of time . <p> As a result , we have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted . The precious 24 hours of each day are carved up , dissected , and reduced to 10-minute units of efficiency . We become agitated and angry in the waiting room of a doctor 's office if we 've been standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our laser printers do n't spit out at least five pages a minute . We can not sit quietly in a chair for 10 minutes . And we must be connected to the grid at all times . We take our smartphones and laptops with us on vacation . We go through our email at restaurants , or our online bank accounts while walking in the park . We have become slaves to our \" urgent \" appointments and to-do lists and addiction to nonstop stimulation by the external world . A momentous but little discussed study by the University of Hertfordshire in collaboration with the British Council found that the walking speed of pedestrians in 34 cities around the world increased by 10 percent just in the 10-year period from 1995 to 2005 . And all of this has happened invisibly . Little by little , the noise and speed of the world have increased , so that we can hardly remember an era of slowness and quiet , when we could let our minds wander and think about what they wanted to think about , when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in . <p> But now we have been struck . With many workplaces shut down , with restaurants and movie theaters and printing shops and department stores closed , now that many of us spend the 24 hours of each day sequestered in the small caves of our homes , suddenly we find ourselves alone with our thoughts . ( Excluded here are such people as the heroic workers in health care and in grocery stores , and parents with young children or elderly relatives needing constant attention . ) At home , time and space have opened up in our minds . <p> Even for those who continue their professional life working online , schedules have become more flexible . Demands have retreated . Daily routines have been interrupted . We suddenly have unstructured , free-floating , beckoning time . This terrible disaster has freed us from the prison of our time-driven lives . At least for a few months , we have the chance to slow down . In the past , we 've had little opportunity to do so , swept along by the rushing tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What might be regained with a less hurried life ? First , as many people have noted and as I discussed in my book In Praise of Wasting Time , there is simply the needed replenishment of mind that comes from doing nothing in particular , from taking long mental walks without destination , from finding a few moments of quiet away from the noise of the world . The mind needs to rest . The mind needs periods of calm . Such a need has been recognized for thousands of years . It was described as early as 1500 B.C. , in the meditation traditions of Hinduism . Later in Buddhism . An ancient passage from the Buddhist Dhammapada reads : \" When a monk has gone into an empty place and has calmed his mind , he experiences a delight that transcends that of other men . \" <p> With some degree of freedom from our time-driven lives also comes increased creativity . Psychologists have long known that creativity thrives on unstructured time , on play , on nondirected \" divergent thinking , \" on unpurposed ramblings through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four-hour-long walks after lunch , stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook . Carl Jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he took time off from his frenzied practice in Zurich to go to his country house in Bollingen , Switzerland . In the middle of a writing project , Gertrude Stein would wander about the countryside looking at cows . We and our children need more time to play . In a 2007 clinical report for the American Academy of Pediatrics , the physician Kenneth R. Ginsburg wrote that \" play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination , dexterity , and physical , cognitive , and emotional strength . \" Yet \" many children are being raised in an increasingly hurried and pressured style that may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play . \" With the forced slowing of life granted by the coronavirus , we are now seeing an explosion of creative ideas and innovations in many parts of the world . In Italy , quarantined citizens are singing from balconies . Writers have created new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . <p> But there is something more to be regained , something more subtle , more delicate , almost impossible even to name . That is the restoration of our inner selves . By inner self , I mean that part of me that imagines , that dreams , that explores , that is constantly questioning who I am and what is important to me . My inner self is my true freedom . My inner self roots me to me , and to the ground beneath me . The sunlight and soil that nourish my inner self are solitude and personal reflection . When I listen to my inner self , I hear the breathing of my spirit . Those breaths are so tiny and delicate , I need stillness to hear them , I need slowness to hear them . I need vast silent spaces in my mind . I need privacy . Without the breathing and the voice of my inner self , I am a prisoner of the frenzied world around me . I am a prisoner of my job , my money , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need slowness and quiet to ponder that question . <p> Sometimes , I picture America as a person and think that , like a person , our entire nation has an inner self . If so , does our nation recognize that it has an inner self , does it nourish that inner self , listen to its breathing in order to know who America is and what it believes in and where it is going ? If citizens of this nation , like me , have lost something of our own inner selves , then what of the nation as a whole ? If our nation can not listen to its inner self , how can it listen to others ? If our nation can not grant itself true inner freedom , how can it allow freedom for others ? How can it bring itself into a respectful understanding and harmonious coexistence with other nations and cultures , so that we might truly contribute to peace and well-being in the world ? <p> Like many of us , I will have the chance do that pondering for several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , is not a onetime event . It should be an ongoing part of a life lived deliberately , to use Henry David Thoreau 's language . And that deliberate living requires an enduring change of lifestyle and habits . At some point , the coronavirus will pass , or at least recede into the haze of other viruses and ailments . There will be ( and already is ) staggering suffering and loss of life , enormous economic devastation . That tragedy can not be overstated . For years , we will be trying to rebuild the broken world . But perhaps the slower lifestyle in these months can help put the pieces back together .

About 70 people in their 20s traveled in a large group from Austin , Texas , to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico in mid-March . On Tuesday , the Austin Public Health Department announced 28 of them have tested positive for COVID-19 . By Wednesday night , the number infected had risen to 44 . <p> The group flew to Mexico on a charter flight about a week and a half ago and some of the vacationers returned on separate commercial flights , the City of Austin said in a press release . <p> \" Austin Public Health and UT Health Austin and University Health Services have made contact with every spring breaker onboard the plane using flight manifests from the Center for Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release reads , adding that the \" confirmed cases are self-isolating at this time . Others are under quarantine while being monitored and tested . \" <p> Four of the confirmed cases did not present any symptoms , officials said . <p> According to the University of Texas , many of those on the trip were UT Austin students , with all of the 44 positive cases being students , CBS Austin reports . <p> A federal travel advisory was not in place for Mexico when the students traveled there ; however the city says all residents should follow the CDC 's recommendations that all non-essential international travel should be avoided . \" A leisure vacation of any kind is not considered essential , \" the press release reads . <p> Nearly half of the positive COVID-19 cases in Austin-Travis County are in people between the ages of 20 and 40 , the city says . The CDC recently reported that young adults ages 20 to 44 make up nearly a third of all cases nationwide , and some of those patients get very sick . Even those who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease to others who may be more vulnerable . <p> \" The virus often hides in the healthy and is given to those who are at grave risk of being hospitalized or dying , \" Austin-Travis County Interim Health Authority Dr. Mark Escott said . \" While younger people have less risk for complications , they are not immune from severe illness and death from COVID-19 . \" <p> The news from Austin comes about two weeks after the University of Tampa announced at least five students tested positive for coronavirus after traveling with other students from the school for spring break . Crowds of spring breakers in Florida were criticized for ignoring social distancing guidelines and packing beaches in complete disregard of the potential risk , before communities finally closed the beaches . <p> Spring breakers seen in a viral video posted by CBS News showed little concern about the virus while partying in Miami . <p> \" If I get corona , I get corona , \" Brady Sluder , one of the young people in the video , said . \" At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from partying . I 've been waiting , we 've been waiting for Miami spring break for a while . About two months we 've had this trip planned , two , three months , and we 're just out here having a good time . \" <p> Sluder has since apologized for his remarks . \" I would like to sincerely apologize for the insensitive comment I made in regards to COVID-19 while I was on spring break , \" he said . \" I was n't aware of the severity of my actions and comments . Like many others , I have elderly people who I adore more than anything in the world and other members who are at risk , and I understand how concerning this disease is for us all . \" <p> Many millennials and even younger people may be ignoring these social distancing warnings because they think coronavirus wo n't affect them -- but they 're wrong . While patients age 60 or older or those with underlying health issues face the highest risk of death from the virus , younger people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hospitalized with the virus are in the 20-to-44 age group . <p> \" This big idea of social distancing , we ca n't hammer it home enough , \" CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula said on \" CBS This Morning \" in March . \" This comes down to something we call the reproduction factor -- that 's how infectious I am . So if I hypothetically have the disease , I can spread it , we think with coronavirus , to three people . \" <p> \" That reproduction number is affected by the virus properties itself , who is susceptible , but also the duration of contact with individuals and the number of people you contact , \" Narula said . Decreasing the number of people you contact and the duration can significantly slow down the spread of the virus , she said .

      "|@@31755441 <p> By now , you may have noticed a divide among your friends . As social distancing and self-imposed quarantine wear on and more workplaces urge employees to avoid the office , the Covid-19 outbreak has left many people more alone than they 've been in a long time , or ever . Some are responding by hunkering down into cozy domesticity : baking bread , reading books , taking long baths . Others have begun to fray : FaceTiming with friends is a necessity , not a luxury ; the closure of a favorite coffee shop is cause for tears ; the walls seem to be closing in . Be kind to your local extroverts . They 're having a hard time . <p> Still , no matter how hygge you 're feeling at this moment , experts suggest that the negative feelings and experiences associated with prolonged isolation will come for us all . Humans are social creatures -- yes , all of us . While the coronavirus pandemic is an extreme , largely unprecedented moment , the kind of seclusion that 's been eating at people over the last few weeks is not as uncommon an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation on our bodies and minds have been felt and studied in a variety of different groups , from astronauts to incarcerated people to immunocompromised children to Antarctic researchers to the elderly . The patterns that have emerged from their experiences with radical aloneness illuminate ways to understand and improve your own . <p> First off , it 's important to remember that isolation does n't just numb your brain with boredom . \" People start getting lethargic when they do n't have positive inputs into their small worlds , \" says John Vincent , a clinical psychologist at the University of Houston . \" We can expect depression to kick in , and depression and anxiety are kissing cousins . \" These symptoms are likely to be particularly intense during coronavirus-related isolation , according to Lawrence Palinkas , who researches psychosocial adaptation to extreme environments at the University of Southern California . \" Oftentimes , if you have a very well defined period of time in which you 're isolated people do pretty well up until the halfway point , \" Palinkas says . \" Then they experience a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we are now , when you 're not certain how long you 'll be asked to maintain social distance , that produces anxiety as well . \" <p> When people , like those kept in solitary confinement or scientists working in a remote region , know their sentence is nearly up , their mood lifts again in anticipation . Those practicing social distancing due to Covid-19 may not get that any time soon . \" Open , transparent , consistent communication is the most important thing governments and organizations can do : Make sure people understand why they are being quarantined first and foremost , how long it is expected to last , \" says Samantha Brooks , who has studied the psychological impact of quarantine at King 's College London . \" A huge factor in the negative psychological impact seems to be confusion about what 's going on , not having clear guidelines , or getting different messages from different organizations . \" So far , many governments , including the United States ' , have n't been heeding this advice . <p> Perhaps even more concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Harry Taylor , who studies social isolation in older adults , particularly in the black community , says that it 's one of the worst things that humans can do to their overall well-being , adding that \" the mortality effect of social isolation is like smoking 15 cigarettes per day . \" In older people , social isolation seems to exacerbate any preexisting medical conditions , from cardiovascular diseases to Alzheimer 's , but its ill effects are n't limited to those over 60 . <p> Alexander Chouker , a physician researcher who studies stress immunology at the University of Munich , has seen radical changes in the bodies of people participating in simulations of manned spaceflight missions like Mars-500 . \" They were young and trained people not in a condition of real threat , \" he says . \" The pure fact of being confined affects the body . If you change your environment in a quite extreme way , it is changing you . \" Participants , some of whom were only isolated for three months , experienced changes to their sleep , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alterations to their metabolisms . \" Being confined and isolated affects the human physiology as a whole , \" Chouker says . <p> Does this mean your body will go wonky like an astronaut trapped on fake Mars for over a year ? Not necessarily . You probably are n't truly socially isolated , at least not to that extreme degree . And even those who study the negative consequences of social isolation still think practicing social distancing is a good idea . \" Covid-19 is flipping everything on its head , \" Taylor says . \" This is the first time since we have been alive that actively practicing social isolation is a method to improve health . \" <p> The people who are most at risk from the isolation associated with Covid-19 are the people who are at heightened risk of social isolation in the first place . \" Among older adults , lower income people and men experience isolation at a different level , \" says Thomas Cudjoe , a geriatrician researching the intersection of social connections and aging at Johns Hopkins University . ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inclination to develop social ties outside of work creates the disparity between those groups and their female or higher income counterparts . ) Taylor points out that anyone who is marginalized is more likely to have a more limited social network , whether they are a member of the LGBTQ+ community , a survivor of domestic abuse , or just live in a more isolated rural area . <p> These people may not have friends or family to call , or may be unable to do so . \" Some people have posited technology as a means of connecting people , but lower income groups might not even have FaceTime or Skype or minutes on their phone , \" Cudjoe says . \" People take that for granted , using their devices can be a strain on people 's incomes . \" Particularly if Covid-19 has left them out of a job . \" Minority bodies are going to be hit particularly hard because they often work in service industries , which increases risk for social isolation and loneliness and coronavirus , \" says Taylor . \" It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No matter what your unique situation is , there are many things you can do to improve your experience while being socially isolated . Chouker and others recommend exercise as a mood boost . \" Create as much structure and predictability as you can with the pieces of your life that you do have control over , \" Vincent says . Pursue neglected projects , get on with life , but also be patient with yourself -- both now and when this strange time eventually ends . People who go through a period of isolation , whether they 've been on the International Space Station or in quarantine , often experience PTSD symptoms and struggle while reintegrating back into their ordinary routine . Social isolation may gradually become your normal , and losing it may still be a jolt . <p> Fortunately , you 're not in this alone , and you should n't leave others that way , either . \" For the general public who are not isolated , think about those people who were in your network that you have n't heard from in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" Cudjoe says . \" Strengthen those weak connections . \" With any luck , you 'll emerge from social distancing a whole lot closer . <p> Emma Grey Ellis is a staff writer at WIRED , specializing in internet culture and propaganda , as well as writing about planetary science and other things space-related .

Researchers with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and the University at Buffalo are part of a trial to see if a biological medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis can tamp that down in at least some patients . ( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) <p> An immunology and molecular biologist pioneer who grew up here and now works in California hailed the news that some of the sickest Covid-19 patients at local hospitals began receiving an experimental treatment led by a researcher from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center . <p> \" Nice to see Buffalo on the cutting edge , \" said Andy Blidy , who grew up on the West Side and in Evans . <p> Blidy voiced great hopes for the trial , in which health providers at three hospitals will administer sarilumab , a monoclonal antibody against a protein that can worsen symptoms for those whose novel coronavirus has reached the critical stage in the ICU . <p> He moved to Boston in the 1980s to do graduate work at Tufts Medical School with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco region , diagnostics for HIV at BD Monoclonal Center and Applied Biosystems on the Human Genome Project . <p> Sarilumab and tocilizumab are both biologic medications given by injection to dial back inflammation for those with rheumatoid arthritis , easing swelling and joint pain . <p> They do so by supressing the free flow of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , a protein that in the lungs can supercharge inflammation and dramatically lower oxygen levels for the sickest of Covid-19 patients . <p> Dr. Igor Puzanov , director of the Early Phase Clinical Trials Program and chief of melanoma services at Roswell Park , leads the new trial . He works extensively with tocilizumab . <p> \" Some of the ways that Covid-19 affects the body are similar to how cancer and autoimmune conditions affect the body , so we can draw on what we know from those fields to address the pressing challenge of how best to treat the novel coronavirus , \" he said . <p> The two medications are among dozens of treatments made from antibodies that researchers around the world are using to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest drug companies are involved in the effort . Blidy predicted those companies should be able to ramp up production within months if one or more treatments work . He predicted it will be more than one , possibly a combination . He also expressed hope for a stem-cell treatment being developed by the biotech firm Athersys to fight acute respiratory distress syndrome , the most dangerous of Covid-19 symptoms . <p> \" Data from China suggest that the IL-6 pathway may play an important role in the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients with Covid-19 , \" said Dr. George D. Yancopoulos , co-founder , president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , which makes sarilumab . \" Despite this encouraging finding , it 's imperative to conduct a properly designed , randomized trial to understand the true impact . \" <p> The Buffalo Niagara region is among 16 sites around the world in the multi-center study , which started in New York State . Regeneron looks to enroll up to 400 patients . <p> \" We hope to announce soon clinical trials of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Western New York and elsewhere , \" said Dr. James Mohler , a urologist and associate director and senior vice president for Translational Research and Chief of Inter-Institutional Academics at Roswell Park . <p> Blidy said he sees a new age of biology about to begin as researchers get to work trying to halt the latest new virus , one that has stopped most of the world in its tracks . <p> He wishes scientists got more love from the general public , most of whom know few beyond Dr. Anthony Fauci , who has served until recently in near anonymity as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 . <p> Scott Scanlon -- Scott Scanlon , an award-winning reporter , is editor of WNY Refresh , which focuses on health , fitness , nutrition and family matters .

Patients sometimes also require paralytic drugs to loosen up their vocal cords and other muscles to prevent damage when the breathing tube is inserted . <p> Patients continue to receive sedatives and pain relievers to keep them asleep while intubated , to prevent their bodies from fighting against both the breathing tube and the ventilator , which performs breathing functions for patients to allow their own lungs to heal . <p> With many COVID-19 patients requiring ventilators for weeks , some health officials are worried that the nation 's supply of necessary drugs wo n't be enough to help the country weather a prolonged and sustained outbreak across multiple cities and states . <p> Dr. Erin Fox , who tracks and investigates drug shortages reported from hospitals around the country , told ABC News that some of the most commonly used drugs to intubate and maintain a patient on ventilator are running in short supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way , and we do n't see a tsunami of drug availability coming our way . It 's scary to think , you might not have enough medicine , \" she said . <p> Three of the drugs reportedly in short supply , according to Fox , are the sedative etomidate , an anesthetic ketamine and a muscle-relaxing medication called rocuronium . Several hospitals with whom ABC News spoke said they were running low on the critical medications . <p> Medical supplies for COVID-19 testing are pictured at the Summit Community Care Clinic in Frisco , Colo. , March 30 , 2020 . <p> While doctors and hospitals have the ability to use alternative drugs in some cases to help intubate and sedate patients , experts worry that a prolonged worldwide outbreak could severely stretch the global pharmaceutical supply chain , forcing countries to fight among one another for resources as several states have been forced to do for protective equipment in the U.S. <p> The American Society of Health System Pharmacists runs the database that monitors drug shortages reported from their 55,000 members across the country who work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in hot spots , but nationwide . <p> \" With all this surge capacity that 's being built , do we have the drug supply to match it ? Right now the answer appears to be ' no , ' \" said Dr. Michael Ganio , a senior director with the society . <p> At one health system that runs over 40 hospitals in Ohio and Virginia , a pharmacy director told ABC News they are starting to see shortages in medications used to sedate patients who are ventilated . Their pharmacy team is already coming up with contingency plans for when the preferred drugs run out . <p> \" The problem is , we 're all using the same manufacturers and same wholesalers . We 're all competing for the same resource , \" the director said . <p> This report was featured in the Wednesday , April 1 , 2020 , episode of \" Start Here , \" ABC News ' daily news podcast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
      "|@@31755841 <p> Staffers of former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg are staring down the possibility of losing their jobs and health care in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic . <p> When he joined the race last year , the billionaire said he would employ his campaign staff through the November election , even if he were n't the nominee . But Bloomberg dropped out after a poor showing on Super Tuesday , and he has since fired staffers in multiple waves . His campaign had announced earlier in March that it would launch an independent expenditure group to take on Trump that would employ former campaign staffers in swing states . <p> Instead of creating his own organization in swing states , Bloomberg 's campaign said on Friday , he will donate $18 million to the Democratic National Committee -- allowing the party to potentially hire organizers themselves . <p> That means many Bloomberg organizers are out of a job . Organizers in six swing states were informed this morning that they were being let go and given instructions for applying to the DNC . <p> \" He 's chopping his employees in a pandemic , \" said one staffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had signed a nondisclosure agreement . \" My life is now uprooted and I 'm effectively homeless . \" <p> Another staffer in North Carolina said he and many other former campaign employees were \" completely blindsided \" by the news on Friday that they were losing their jobs . <p> \" It 's fucking scary , \" he said of the thought of staffers losing health care in the middle of the pandemic . <p> A Bloomberg campaign spokesperson said that staffers in the six battleground states who were supposed to be part of the former candidate 's now-aborted group \" will be employed and paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April . \" <p> The Florida staffer , who had previously been on Medicaid , moved to a swing state on the promise of a stable , well-paying job through November . Without their own place to live , the staffer said , they planned to stay with family to wait out the coronavirus outbreak . <p> Bloomberg had already broken a promise of employment through November to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three-month presidential campaign , on which he spent a record $687 million of his personal fortune . Staffers who were not in swing states were let go earlier this month . <p> But at the time , said the Florida staffer , they were still under the impression they would be employed by a Bloomberg campaign entity . \" We got the message , ' Hey do n't worry , you guys are fine . ' \" <p> The Bloomberg spokesperson said staffers were being encouraged to apply to work for the DNC : \" The DNC Coordinated Campaign is hiring in every one of the six battleground states we identified -- and more . And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to , including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible . \" <p> Staffers in swing states learned they were being let go on a call on Friday morning by campaign states director Dan Kanninen and human resources representative Katherine Sayers . According to a script for the call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DNC instead of creating an independent expenditure group , saying a separate group \" would simply not be as effective or efficient in our goal of defeating Donald Trump in November . \" <p> \" We want as many of the organizing team from Mike2020 as possible to join the DNC 's effort -- and we have designed a structure to facilitate the process for those who express interest , \" Kanninen said , according to the call script . <p> Employees learned they had five days to apply for DNC jobs in order to be considered . Sayers , the HR representative , told them to fill out a Google Form no later than March 25 , even if they had \" previously noted interest in future opportunities as part of your off-boarding last week . \" <p> The Google Form will not guarantee Bloomberg staffers a job with the DNC . Instead , their information will be \" fed into a competitive hiring process , \" Sayers told staffers on the phone call , \" and you will hear from the DNC on that process and next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire and onboard their new staff as expediently as possible . \" <p> \" There will be an application process , \" the DNC official said on Friday . \" Bloomberg organizers can apply . \" <p> The DNC official declined to say exactly how many jobs will open as a result of the transfer but said the $18 million will allow the party to hire \" hundreds \" of new organizers for its existing \" Battleground Build-Up 2020 \" program , which funds offices and field organizers across 12 states that will be critical in the general election . <p> $18 million marks a significant influx of cash for the DNC . <p> The Democratic Party routinely lags in fundraising behind the GOP , with Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee bringing in more than $100 million last quarter . Joe Biden , the candidate best positioned to clinch the Democratic nomination this summer , is still in the midst of professionalizing his field and fundraising programs for the general election . <p> Bloomberg previously discussed spending up to $1 billion of his own money to help defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bloomberg campaign leadership had made the choice not to create a separate independent expenditure organization or super PAC , a move that may limit his spending in the future . <p> The $18 million transfer , a small fraction of what he 's discussed spending in the past , is the first money Bloomberg has publicly pledged since dropping out of the race two weeks ago . <p> \" There are good people out there that left their jobs behind to go work for a candidate that honestly most of us did n't believe in the first place , \" said the former staffer in Florida . \" We did it for the necessity . We did it for the job security . \"

The world 's appetite for energy has been massively hit since the outbreak of novel coronavirus . With 3 billion people in lockdown , International Energy Agency ( IEA ) reckons global oil demand will witness a drop of 20% in the near future . Further , the fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia has resulted in a supply glut of crude oil and sparked off a relentless price war , depressing prices further and hurting the global energy industry . <p> Top oil and gas giants offer stable dividend payouts , a strategy to maintain the appeal of the stock among investors . However , as the world fights a pandemic , top energy companies will have to reassess their payout strategies , either by slowing down share buybacks or reintroducing non-cash dividends . <p> Re-modelling of Strategies a Pressing Priority <p> Many oil companies had cut expenses during the 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including booming U.S. shale oil production and shifting OPEC policies . Oil majors like TOTAL S.A. TOT and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A issued scrip dividends after the last slump , which enabled them to issue dividends in the form of shares rather than cash . <p> Let 's see how these companies are dealing with the oil downturn this time around . <p> The latest fall in crude has led several oil giants to slash their 2020 spending plans . Supermajors like Shell , TOTAL and Chevron CVX have rationalized their planned capital budgeting for the current year to weather the crisis . <p> Shell plans to trim its 2020 capital spending by a minimum of $5 billion from the past projection of $25 billion to $20 billion along with material reductions in working capital . It further plans to cut operating costs by $3-$4 billion over the next 12 months . Shell has also suspended its $25-billion share buyback plan . <p> TOTAL has decided to lower its 2020 capital expenditure guidance by nearly 20% to less than $15 billion from the prior $18 billion . <p> Chevron has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and aims to lower its run-rate operating costs in excess of $1 billion by this year-end . It has also suspended its $5-billion share repurchase program to weather the weak crude pricing scenario . <p> Italian energy firm Eni E has downwardly revised its 2020 capital budget by roughly ? 2 billion , representing 25% of its total budget . The Zacks Rank #3 ( Hold ) company has also decided to cut operating expenditure for 2020 by almost ? 400 million . Earlier this month , it even rolled back its ? 400 million stock repurchases plan.You can see the complete list of today 's Zacks #1 Rank ( Strong Buy ) stocks here . <p> Equinor ASA EQNR has revised its capital budget this year to $8.5 billion from the earlier $10-$11 billion . <p> With the above measures , the companies are expecting to balance their books , generate enough free cash flow and put a check on escalating debt levels . But none of them have announced dividend cuts yet . Morgan Stanley reckons oil majors ' debt level will rise too high by 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve as expected , we think European majors will start to reduce dividends in the second half of 2020 , \" says Martijn Rats , Morgan Stanley analyst . <p> Conclusion <p> The market has had to deal with twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic paralysing global energy demand and the unexpected oil price war that erupted between producers Russia and Saudi Arabia earlier this month . Oil majors have time and again expressed their reluctance to cut dividends in order to retain investor interest in the sector , which has suffered a setback due to concerns of long-term sustainability as the world seeks to curtail its use of fossil fuel . The top five oil majors-Chevron , TOTAL , BP plc BP , ExxonMobil XOM and Shell-added a combined $25 billion to debt levels in 2019 to sustain capital spending and return huge amounts to shareholders . <p> Although we expect the companies to be able to sustain their payout in at least 2020 , in order to sustain it , they will have to review their costs and deepen operational and capital expenditure cuts . If energy giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to debt . <p> Oil markets have experienced significant volatility and price declines amid concerns over the economic effects of coronavirus . However , oversupply of oil and slack in demand should not last forever , and once the economy regains momentum , the question to cut dividend payouts will hopefully not arise . Yet , the question on the affordability of such generous returns due to high levels of debt and growing crisis remains pertinent . <p> Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020 <p> In addition to the stocks discussed above , would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2020 ? <p> Last year 's 2019 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio returned gains as high as +102.7% .

He got an email last week saying his internship at Urban Outfitters ' corporate office in Philadelphia was canceled.Credit ... Anthony Lanzilote for The New York Times <p> They hoped to secure jobs on political campaigns , at fashion brands and law offices , and in sales and finance . Instead , they 've had internships canceled and interviews postponed , wandered through empty job fairs and seen recruiters ignore their anxious emails . <p> When the coronavirus pandemic forced college students across the country to leave campus in early March , the abrupt departure was especially painful for seniors . It meant rushed goodbyes , canceled graduation ceremonies -- an overwhelming sense of loss . <p> Now , many of those seniors are home with their families , contemplating an even worse prospect : a job market more grim than any in recent history . Last week , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits , more than quadruple the previous record . <p> As the economy barrels toward a recession , college seniors fear they could become the next class of 2009 , which entered the work force at the peak of the Great Recession as companies conducted mass layoffs and froze hiring . <p> \" That is definitely on everyone 's minds , \" said Tarek Ziad , a senior at Yale studying ecology and evolutionary biology . \" We have to hike up our boots . \" <p> A number of major companies , including Yelp and Disney , have suspended their internship programs , a common route to a first job for many graduating seniors . At some job fairs in early March , major companies simply did n't show up ; now all those career events have been canceled . <p> The number of new job listings posted between mid-February and mid-March dropped 29 percent compared with the same period last year , according to data from the job marketplace ZipRecruiter . Postings for retail stores fell 14 percent , events jobs went down 20 percent and casino and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably get worse over the next few months , as closures and cancellations ripple across the economy . \" These are still early effects . The first wave of industries hit will not be the last , \" said Julia Pollak , a labor economist at ZipRecruiter . \" There will be a large human cost . \" <h> ' Looking into the void ' <p> Andres Salerno , a senior at Butler University in Indianapolis , stayed in his off-campus house after classes went online , one of only a few remaining undergrads in what feels like a ghost town . Practically everyone he knows is anxious about the job market . Some of his roommates are Peace Corps recruits who do n't know whether they 'll be able to leave the country . His girlfriend is a dancer whose professional auditions have been canceled . <p> For his part , Mr. Salerno had hoped to get a job on a political campaign in his home state of Texas -- an option that no longer seems viable as canvassing has ground to a halt . <p> \" Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's upended , \" he said . \" I had a loose idea of what I was doing in a few months . And now I 'm just looking into the void . \" <p> For three years in a row , Isabel Serrano applied for an internship at the same New York lobbying firm , starting when she was a sophomore at New York University . She finally got it last year and started working in January as she finished her last semester at N.Y.U. She hoped it would turn into a job after graduation in May . <p> But a couple of weeks ago , as she took a walk in her parents ' neighborhood in Union County , N.J. , Ms. Serrano got an upsetting phone call : the internship was canceled because of the coronavirus . <p> \" It 's just a sad thing to hear , \" she said . \" I had two more months left to really advocate for myself and that is gone now . \" <h> A decade or more of ' scarring ' <p> Historically , college students who graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious companies than people who finished college even a year earlier . Economists have found that the impact of that bad luck can linger for as long as 10 or 15 years , leading to higher unemployment rates and lower salaries -- a phenomenon known as \" scarring . \" <p> Whether the class of 2020 will face long-term consequences depends on a range of factors , including the length of the pandemic and the severity of the recession that seems certain to follow . But it does n't look good . <p> \" I 'm worried for them , \" said Lisa Kahn , an economist who has studied how recessions affect college graduates . \" If they 're graduating into a large recession , they 're going to suffer some pretty severe short-term consequences . And that 's probably going to stay with them for almost the next decade . \" <p> At her home near Houston , Caroline Carlson , an agricultural economics major at Texas A&amp;M University , has grown increasingly concerned about her chances of landing a job working on sustainability issues at a food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people panic-shopping at grocery stores as a positive -- a reminder that there will always be a market for food . Ms. Carlson remains pessimistic . <p> \" I do n't think companies are really going to be looking to bring on more corporate positions or go through the steps of training someone , \" she said . <p> \" I get emails from Glassdoor daily -- like , ' You 'd be a great fit for Walmart cashier , ' \" she continued . \" Thank you so much , that 's really what I want my bachelor 's degree to go toward . \" <p> A severe downturn could also jeopardize the career prospects of students who graduate later this year or in 2021 . <p> Martin Lang , Jr. , who is set to finish business school at the University of Detroit Mercy in December , got an email last week saying his internship at Urban Outfitters ' corporate office in Philadelphia was canceled . An aspiring stylist , Mr. Lang had hoped to stay at the company long term . \" It would have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in , \" he said . \" Now I 'll go a year without working in a corporate environment . \" <p> Career counselors at some major universities are trying to stay upbeat . Kerin Borland , the director of the University of Michigan Career Center , said recruiters have continued to interview students over video chat . The school also turned an in-person job fair into a digital one through a partnership with CareerEco , a virtual recruiting platform . And Ms. Borland said she has encouraged undergraduates to keep in touch with recruiters so they are in the pipeline for future jobs . <p> \" The hope is we will get through this unusual circumstance and move forward , \" Ms. Borland said . \" Employers do n't want to have to start from scratch in terms of building relationships with students . \" <p> Some industries , like nursing , have even seen an increase in job listings , according to ZipRecruiter .

But given the pandemic , she has decided to pursue jobs in public health -- her minor at the University of Florida . \" Now more than ever I can use that part of my college degree to hop on something that 's so prevalent right now , \" she said . <h> All the standard moves are useless <p> Over the last few weeks , many job-hunting seniors have engaged in an awkward dance with recruiters in industries like law , journalism and technology , asking for updates while trying not to seem insensitive or selfish . All the traditional rules of engagement in a job hunt suddenly feel irrelevant . A meet-up for coffee is out of the question . A request for a networking call might seem invasive . <p> Kaylie Ramirez , a senior at Boston College , said she spoke with several recruiters in recent days to discuss job opportunities in financial and strategic communications . One said he empathized with Ms. Ramirez , noting that he graduated in 2009 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as helpful as he could . But others advised her to hold off on sending her r ? sum ? given the uncertainty . <p> \" It was a reality check , \" Ms. Ramirez said . \" I 've gradually been lowering my expectations , and I think that confirmed what I knew deep down , anyway . \" <p> For some seniors , uncertainty about the economy has created outrage . Most of them were in fifth grade in 2008 . But they remember the damage wrought by the Great Recession . <p> \" It 's hard to be motivated or excited about the systems we have in place because we 've seen the mess they 've created over and over again , \" said Ms. Serrano , the senior at N.Y.U. <p> But memories of 2008 -- and the economy 's eventual recovery -- have also been a source of comfort . <p> \" This is the first pandemic that I have lived through , that my parents have lived through , but this is n't the first time the economy has not been great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . \" If we can get through the recession in 2008 , I think we can get through this . \" <h> Answers to Your Frequently Asked Questions <p> Updated March 24 , 2020 <h> How does coronavirus spread ? <p> It seems to spread very easily from person to person , especially in homes , hospitals and other confined spaces . The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out . It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face . <h> What makes this outbreak so different ? <p> Unlike the flu , there is no known treatment or vaccine , and little is known about this particular virus so far . It seems to be more lethal than the flu , but the numbers are still uncertain . And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard . <h> What should I do if I feel sick ? <p> If you 've been exposed to the coronavirus or think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cough or difficulty breathing , call a doctor . They should give you advice on whether you should be tested , how to get tested , and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others . <h> What if somebody in my family gets sick ? <p> If the family member does n't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home , you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms , while also keeping as much distance as possible , according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there 's space , the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom . If masks are available , both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room . Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters , doorknobs , toilets and tables . Do n't forget to wash your hands frequently . <h> Should I wear a mask ? <p> Experts are divided on how much protection a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for people who are n't yet sick . The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless you 're already sick , or caring for someone who is , wearing a face mask is n't necessary . The New York Times and other news outlets have been reporting that the wearing of face masks may not help healthy people , noting that while masks can help prevent the spread of a virus if you are infected , most surgical masks are too loose to prevent inhalation of the virus and the more effective N95 masks , because of shortages at health centers worldwide , should be used only by medical personnel . But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic . And a few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded places where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people . Masks do n't replace hand-washing and social distancing . <h> Should I stock up on groceries ? <p> Plan two weeks of meals if possible .

      "|@@31758141 <p> Saudi Arabia has asked Muslims to wait until there is more clarity about the coronavirus pandemic before planning to attend the annual Hajj pilgrimage , the Minister for Hajj and Umrah said on state TV on Tuesday . <p> Earlier this month , Saudi Arabia suspended the year-round Umrah pilgrimage over fears of the new coronavirus spreading to Islam 's holiest cities , an unprecedented move that raised uncertainty over the annual Hajj . <p> Some 2.5 million pilgrims from around the world usually flock to Mecca and Medina cities for the week-long ritual scheduled to begin in late July . The pilgrimage is also a significant source of income for the kingdom . <p> \" But under the current circumstances , as we are talking about the global pandemic ... the kingdom is keen to protect the health of Muslims and citizens and so we have asked our brother Muslims in all countries to wait before doing Hajj contracts until the situation is clear . \" <p> Besides suspending Umrah pilgrimage , Saudi Arabia has also halted all international passenger flights indefinitely and last week blocked entry and exit to several cities , including Mecca and Medina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia and the backbone of plans to expand visitor numbers under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's ambitious economic reform agenda . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Cancelling the Hajj would be unprecedented in modern times , but curbing attendance from high-risk areas has happened before , including in recent years during the Ebola outbreak . <p> To date , the kingdom has reported just over 1,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and 10 deaths .

Fulton St. , was supposed to open April 3 , but has been closed indefinitely due to concerns about the respiratory disease spreading . <p> But John Ball Zoo has nearly 2,000 animals to feed and take care of . <p> \" We still have mouths , snouts , beaks , and jaws to feed and care for , \" said Peter D'Arienzo , CEO of the John Ball Zoo . <p> \" Our animal care team , veterinarians , and essential facilities crew all remain on grounds to maintain the excellent care that we provide each and every day of the year , while practicing social distancing to keep one another healthy . \" <p> The zoo estimates that it will lose about $1 million each month that it remains closed due to lack of income from admissions , events , experiences , sponsorships , donations , and food and retail sales . <p> Officials say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April through early December . <p> To make up for the hit , the zoo has already put off seasonal hiring and facility improvement projects . They 've also canceled some camps and educational programs . <p> \" The John Ball Zoo family of employees and the broader community is at the center of what we do , and limiting the opportunities available to them is the last thing we want to do , \" said D'Arienzo . <p> \" People love the zoo and we will welcome them back to help us rebuild when we are able to do so . \" <p> The zoo is hoping that as the closure remains in effect , the community will help pitch in . They 're asking people to renew or purchase a zoo membership for themselves or as a gift . <p> People can also donate directly to the Zoo 's Annual Operating Fund , adopt an animal and make plans to visit when the Zoo reopens , the zoo said in a statement . <p> The zoo has had to make some major changes in order to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other safety measures are being taken . <p> They 've sent home all volunteers and now full-time employees have to fill in those gaps . That means the full-time employees are working outside of their usual duties . <p> For example , volunteer divers used to clean the kelp tank , now animal teams who happen to be certified divers have taken on that duty . It 's been a challenge , D'Arienzo said in a statement . <p> Some of the jobs at the zoo are very specialized - like caring for the red pandas or an Amur tiger . <p> \" Everyone is pitching in . None of us have experienced a time like this . We will get through this just as we always do during tough times ; by working together to take care of each other , \" said D'Arienzo.

We 're being told , ' You need this kind of equipment ' and I have no idea what 's going to come in the next couple weeks . <p> \" It is so intense . Not a lot of people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going to be learning together . \" <p> Fonfara , who has yet to directly work with a Covid-19 patient , reassures herself by leaning on her medical training , which is paramount . She also considers what she learned as a high school , college and professional hockey player . <p> \" Everyone 's got to work together to accomplish a goal , \" said Fonfara , an Elma resident who played for the Beauts in 2018-19 . \" That 's what I 've learned from playing sports , all my life , and being on a team and in a level of unity on my floor . \" <p> Fonfara is one of the medical professionals who were college or pro athletes in Western New York who are helping the fight against a public health crisis . <p> Zach Ahart , former UB cross country runner , is now a resident in Cincinnati ( Harry Scull Jr. /Buffalo News file photo ) <p> In Cincinnati , former UB runner Zach Ahart is in his first year of residency in internal medicine . <p> \" I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahart , a former Mid-American Conference cross country champion and a Starpoint graduate . \" As a resident , I do n't work in an emergency room , but if an ER resident feels a patient needs to be admitted , we go to the emergency room , examine a patient and admit them . \" <p> In Philadelphia , Kim Dale is an intensive care nurse who works in outpatient neurology . The former University at Buffalo swimmer has been told that she could return a hospital intensive care unit soon . <p> \" Some days , I have a little bit of anxiety about it , and some days , I know I have the training for it , and I 'm not at all surprised I 'd be asked to go back in , \" said Dale , a 2010 UB graduate . \" Going into nursing , you expect to take care of people in all types of situations . <p> \" A pandemic never crossed my mind when I was training to be a nurse . Other disasters and whatnot cross your mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonfara had a full nursing schedule in addition to playing hockey in her only professional season with the Beauts . She played high school hockey for Lancaster/Iroquois/Depew and played at Elmira College . <p> \" Playing hockey with the Beauts and being a nurse was not easy , \" Fonfara said . \" But everything leading up to today prepared me for this . \" <h> The team approach <p> Dale considered the emphasis on preparation as an athlete , the hours of practice that allowed her to compete in a swim meet . As she awaits word on if and when she will go into an ICU , she has reviewed protocols that have been put in place for ICU nursing , and the treatments , and reviewing ICU work she has already done . <p> \" One thing we were taught was that the No. 1 thing you can do to be ready for competition is to be prepared , to put the training in , \" Dale said . \" Put everything into place and what you can control to get the best outcome . \" <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure situations , but instead of being the player who handles the puck with the game on the line , Fonfara is part of a medical team that negotiates life-or-death scenarios . <p> \" In scary situations , like now , when it comes down to the last minute of a game , you have to be calm and collected , just like now , \" Fonfara said . \" You ca n't freak out . You have to do what you can and what is in your control . That 's what hockey taught me and that 's what sports taught me . When we have a rapid response , I find myself handling it well . You ca n't freak out , or everyone else around you is going to freak out . \" <p> Christian Muller , a former UB swimmer , is a resident doctor with a family medicine practice in New Jersey . He leans on his time-management skills and his ability to self-accommodate in order to navigate a public health crisis . <p> \" It 's an ever-changing world right now , \" said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a race , you need to learn how to adapt . In swimming , you think about what you 're doing in practice versus what you 're doing in competition . If something goes wrong you say , ' okay , I need to change what I am doing to keep this on track and to get better . ' <p> \" In this case , it 's to ensure the safety of the public . \" <h> Preparing for a crisis <p> Shant ? White is an anesthesiology resident physician in Rochester , and she is a former MAC champion in the hammer throw at UB . She has a smaller case load now that many elective surgeries have been canceled , but is preparing to work in the ICU if there is an increase in Covid-19 cases in Rochester requires that level of care . <p> \" I ca n't say if we 're prepared or underprepared , but as soon as all of this started happening , the chief resident and our attendings did a really good job at giving us direction of how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our patients safe , \" said Moore , a 2012 UB graduate . \" It would be unfair to say we 're underprepared , because we are not . We 're making the best of the resources we have , and we 're doing that . We are having a positive , proactive response to it . <p> \" We 're coming together , and we 're trying to figure out the best way to keep ourselves safe while taking care of patients . \" <p> Ahart admits that by some measure , there is some fear that comes in working in medicine during a public health crisis . He 's seen what 's happened in other countries , and has heard many stories of health-care workers becoming ill . <p> \" But it 's our job , \" Ahart said . \" We do what we 've got to do , and we try to stay as healthy as possible . \" <h> Advice for others <p> \" And try to live your best life , \" Ahart said . \" Do n't go stir crazy . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news , but our practices so far , based on what scientists are telling us , it sounds like we 've already made quite an impact on the spread of things . And keep this up . \" <p> Dale is now an avid runner and a triathlete , and she emphasizes cultivating positivity . <p> \" Take an hour or two out of the day to be by yourself , find a way to meditate and get back in the zone , \" Dale said . \" If you find something to escape for an hour or two , and get away from the negative news , things get better . \" <p> Like Ahart , White reiterates much of the clinical advice that 's being emphasized . But she also takes the team-first approach in the fight against the pandemic . <p> \" Support each other , \" White said . \" Realize that the doctors on the front line are the best to take care of these patients , and the best thing for you to do is to do the things that will help prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a college/high school sports enterprise reporter at The Buffalo News .

So , we expect the children to be indoors as much as possible . Once the children are out on the streets selling , then the President 's drive against the coronavirus is defeated because the children become exposed . We know it is going to be difficult for some of the parents . But the end results will be of immense benefit to all of us , \" the MCE had said . <p> Minutes after the arrests , scores of parents trooped to the two holding centers and pleaded for clemency for their wards . <p> In an interview with 3news.com , Public Relations Officer of STMA John Laste said particulars of the children who were arrested and their parents were taken and were cautioned before release . <p> \" What we told the parents is that if their children are arrested for the second time , they will be arraigned before court . A good number of them pleaded and said they will take the warning serious . The team will continue the operation on Tuesday at the other markets within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of compliance , \" he said <p> He added that the team will also ensure enforcement of directives on public gatherings , closure of beaches , provision of handwashing facilities and compliance of social distance at the banks , restaurants , transport terminals and

      "|@@31754641 <p> The Colombo Stock Exchange ( CSE ) has continued to receive inquiries pertaining to the hosting of Annual General Meetings ( AGMs ) and requesting guidance to comply with the mandatory requirement within the boundaries of an excepted framework in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic . Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 via its participants and introduce the virus to new communities . Given the public health and safety concerns related to COVID-19 , the CSE in its continued efforts to promote social distancing and discourage public gatherings has offered guidance to assist Listed Companies in meeting their obligation of hosting an AGM . <p> The Listing Rules of the CSE do not contain specific provisions relating to the date on which an AGM is to be hosted by a listed company . As such , listed companies will be required to comply with the applicable provisions set out in the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 ( ' Companies Act ' ) and the Articles of Association of the company in this regard . <p> This interim guidance is intended to act as a guideline for companies listed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted in hosting AGMs amidst the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic . The guidance offered is purely for information purposes and should be construed only as a guide . It is imperative that a listed company obtain appropriate legal advice in determining the most appropriate arrangement regarding the conduct of an AGM in the current context . <p> The following measures/factors can be considered by listed companies in this regard : <p> Postponement of the AGM <p> The company could decide to postpone its scheduled/to be scheduled AGM awaiting a more conducive environment to surface . A listed company that has already scheduled and disclosed its AGM is required to notify the CSE of its postponement . Preferably , this notice may be published in the newspapers as well . <p> The payment of a final dividend , already announced by a listed company and is in requirement of the approval of its shareholders , would also be postponed accordingly . The company could also decide to pay an interim dividend instead of the announced final dividend provided adequate prior notice can be given to the market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could choose electronic means ( subject to legal advice ) to serve notices and other communications regarding the AGM to its shareholders . <p> Any postponement of the AGM will be subject to the timelines specified in Section 133 of the Companies Act and if unable to comply , the company is advised to consult the Registrar General of Companies for further guidance . <p> Virtual AGMs <p> Companies listed on the CSE have also been presented with the option of hosting its AGM virtually to comply with the regulatory requirements and restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic . This may include electronic and teleconference mechanisms to host the AGM such as Facebook Live , WEB Ex , Zoom , Webinar . <p> A company could choose to explore this alternate avenue unless restricted by its Articles of Association and subject to legal advice .

was contracting with hotels as part of a massive effort to add 65,000 additional hospital beds by the end of the month . <p> De Blasio , also a Democrat , said the city had arranged to add 10,000 beds at 20 hotels , which have lost most of their guests as travel has stopped . <p> \" This is going to be an epic process during the month of April to build out all that capacity , \" de Blasio said . \" But this goal can be reached . \" <p> California saw the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more than 8000 as Governor Gavin Newsom warned that even as stay-at-home policies appeared to be having some effect , the state would run out of intensive- care hospital beds equipped with ventilators within six weeks . <p> Newsom said California could still manage to \" bend \" the state 's infection curve more , saving the need for additional beds , if residents were rigorous in staying home and avoiding contact with others . <p> \" We are in a completely different place than the state of New York and I hope we will continue to be , but we wo n't unless people continue to practice physical distancing and do their part , \" the Democratic governor told a news conference in the state capital ,

Ron DeSantis told Fox News that Broward County would likely allow two cruise ships with coronavirus outbreaks carrying a total of 2,500 people to dock in Fort Lauderdale , despite his misgivings about potentially contagious foreign nationals . <p> \" We were concerned about a deluge into the hospitals , but I think it turns out that there will probably be some who need to go , but it 's very

      "|@@31755241 <h> The Virus Is a Reminder of Something Lost Long Ago <p> Editor 's Note:The Atlantic is making vital coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers . Find the collection here . <p> Around the year 1600 , the weather in much of Europe substantially cooled , in the latter phase of what has been called the Little Ice Age . In all , it lasted 300 years . Winters were brutally cold and summers were damp and chilly , greatly curtailing the growing season . Crops failed . People starved . But the change in weather forced English , French , and Dutch fishermen to build improved boats , capable of following fish farther to the west and surviving long trips through the rough seas . Undoubtedly , some of that new boat-building craft led to the ships of today . <p> Innovation often arises in periods of adversity . In recent weeks , we have seen such welcome invention germinating in the horrendous crisis of the coronavirus . Consider , for example , the many new platforms for online teaching , or the use of cheap Bluetooth smart thermometers able to transmit a person 's fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toronto Symphony Orchestra performing together and apart from 29 different locations using their smartphones . <p> In bad times , innovation can occur in habits of mind as well as in new technologies . The frightening COVID-19 pandemic may be creating such a change now -- by forcing many of us to slow down , to spend more time in personal reflection , away from the noise and heave of the world . With more quiet time , more privacy , more stillness , we have an opportunity to think about who we are , as individuals and as a society . <p> Habits of mind and lifestyle do not change easily . Without noticing , we slowly slip into the routines of our lives , like becoming so accustomed to living on a noisy street that we can not remember our previous neighborhood and a time of silence . Some powerful force must strike to awaken us from our slumber . Now we have been struck . We have a chance to notice : We have been living too fast . We have sold our inner selves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" progress . \" <p> Since the Industrial Revolution , the pace of life has been driven by the speed of commerce and business . And the speed of business , in turn , has been driven by the speed of communication . In the 1830s , the fast , new communication device was the telegraph , which could relay information at about 3 bits a second . That speed rose to about 1,000 bits a second in the mid-1980s with the advent of the internet . Today , the rate is 1,000,000,000 bits a second . The resulting increase in productivity in the workplace , coupled with the time-equals-money equation , has led to our acute awareness of the commercial and goal-oriented uses of time . <p> As a result , we have created a frenzied lifestyle in which not a minute is to be wasted . The precious 24 hours of each day are carved up , dissected , and reduced to 10-minute units of efficiency . We become agitated and angry in the waiting room of a doctor 's office if we 've been standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our laser printers do n't spit out at least five pages a minute . We can not sit quietly in a chair for 10 minutes . And we must be connected to the grid at all times . We take our smartphones and laptops with us on vacation . We go through our email at restaurants , or our online bank accounts while walking in the park . We have become slaves to our \" urgent \" appointments and to-do lists and addiction to nonstop stimulation by the external world . A momentous but little discussed study by the University of Hertfordshire in collaboration with the British Council found that the walking speed of pedestrians in 34 cities around the world increased by 10 percent just in the 10-year period from 1995 to 2005 . And all of this has happened invisibly . Little by little , the noise and speed of the world have increased , so that we can hardly remember an era of slowness and quiet , when we could let our minds wander and think about what they wanted to think about , when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in . <p> But now we have been struck . With many workplaces shut down , with restaurants and movie theaters and printing shops and department stores closed , now that many of us spend the 24 hours of each day sequestered in the small caves of our homes , suddenly we find ourselves alone with our thoughts . ( Excluded here are such people as the heroic workers in health care and in grocery stores , and parents with young children or elderly relatives needing constant attention . ) At home , time and space have opened up in our minds . <p> Even for those who continue their professional life working online , schedules have become more flexible . Demands have retreated . Daily routines have been interrupted . We suddenly have unstructured , free-floating , beckoning time . This terrible disaster has freed us from the prison of our time-driven lives . At least for a few months , we have the chance to slow down . In the past , we 've had little opportunity to do so , swept along by the rushing tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What might be regained with a less hurried life ? First , as many people have noted and as I discussed in my book In Praise of Wasting Time , there is simply the needed replenishment of mind that comes from doing nothing in particular , from taking long mental walks without destination , from finding a few moments of quiet away from the noise of the world . The mind needs to rest . The mind needs periods of calm . Such a need has been recognized for thousands of years . It was described as early as 1500 B.C. , in the meditation traditions of Hinduism . Later in Buddhism . An ancient passage from the Buddhist Dhammapada reads : \" When a monk has gone into an empty place and has calmed his mind , he experiences a delight that transcends that of other men . \" <p> With some degree of freedom from our time-driven lives also comes increased creativity . Psychologists have long known that creativity thrives on unstructured time , on play , on nondirected \" divergent thinking , \" on unpurposed ramblings through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four-hour-long walks after lunch , stopping to jot down ideas in his notebook . Carl Jung did his most creative thinking and writing when he took time off from his frenzied practice in Zurich to go to his country house in Bollingen , Switzerland . In the middle of a writing project , Gertrude Stein would wander about the countryside looking at cows . We and our children need more time to play . In a 2007 clinical report for the American Academy of Pediatrics , the physician Kenneth R. Ginsburg wrote that \" play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination , dexterity , and physical , cognitive , and emotional strength . \" Yet \" many children are being raised in an increasingly hurried and pressured style that may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play . \" With the forced slowing of life granted by the coronavirus , we are now seeing an explosion of creative ideas and innovations in many parts of the world . In Italy , quarantined citizens are singing from balconies . Writers have created new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . <p> But there is something more to be regained , something more subtle , more delicate , almost impossible even to name . That is the restoration of our inner selves . By inner self , I mean that part of me that imagines , that dreams , that explores , that is constantly questioning who I am and what is important to me . My inner self is my true freedom . My inner self roots me to me , and to the ground beneath me . The sunlight and soil that nourish my inner self are solitude and personal reflection . When I listen to my inner self , I hear the breathing of my spirit . Those breaths are so tiny and delicate , I need stillness to hear them , I need slowness to hear them . I need vast silent spaces in my mind . I need privacy . Without the breathing and the voice of my inner self , I am a prisoner of the frenzied world around me . I am a prisoner of my job , my money , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need slowness and quiet to ponder that question . <p> Sometimes , I picture America as a person and think that , like a person , our entire nation has an inner self . If so , does our nation recognize that it has an inner self , does it nourish that inner self , listen to its breathing in order to know who America is and what it believes in and where it is going ? If citizens of this nation , like me , have lost something of our own inner selves , then what of the nation as a whole ? If our nation can not listen to its inner self , how can it listen to others ? If our nation can not grant itself true inner freedom , how can it allow freedom for others ? How can it bring itself into a respectful understanding and harmonious coexistence with other nations and cultures , so that we might truly contribute to peace and well-being in the world ? <p> Like many of us , I will have the chance do that pondering for several months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , is not a onetime event . It should be an ongoing part of a life lived deliberately , to use Henry David Thoreau 's language . And that deliberate living requires an enduring change of lifestyle and habits . At some point , the coronavirus will pass , or at least recede into the haze of other viruses and ailments . There will be ( and already is ) staggering suffering and loss of life , enormous economic devastation . That tragedy can not be overstated . For years , we will be trying to rebuild the broken world . But perhaps the slower lifestyle in these months can help put the pieces back together . And perhaps a more contemplative , deliberate way of living can become permanent . <p> We want to hear what you think about this article .

About 70 people in their 20s traveled in a large group from Austin , Texas , to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico in mid-March . On Tuesday , the Austin Public Health Department announced 28 of them have tested positive for COVID-19 . By Wednesday night , the number infected had risen to 44 . <p> The group flew to Mexico on a charter flight about a week and a half ago and some of the vacationers returned on separate commercial flights , the City of Austin said in a press release . <p> \" Austin Public Health and UT Health Austin and University Health Services have made contact with every spring breaker onboard the plane using flight manifests from the Center for Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release reads , adding that the \" confirmed cases are self-isolating at this time .

Crowds of spring breakers in Florida were criticized for ignoring social distancing guidelines and packing beaches in complete disregard of the potential risk , before communities finally closed the beaches . <p> Spring breakers seen in a viral video posted by CBS News showed little concern about the virus while partying in Miami . <p> \" If I get corona , I get corona , \" Brady Sluder , one of the young people in the video , said . \" At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from partying .

So if I hypothetically have the disease , I can spread it , we think with coronavirus , to three people . \" <p> \" That reproduction number is affected by the virus properties itself , who is susceptible , but also the duration of contact with individuals and the number of people you contact , \" Narula said . Decreasing the number of people you contact and the duration can significantly slow down the spread of the virus , she said .

      "|@@31755441 <p> By now , you may have noticed a divide among your friends . As social distancing and self-imposed quarantine wear on and more workplaces urge employees to avoid the office , the Covid-19 outbreak has left many people more alone than they 've been in a long time , or ever . Some are responding by hunkering down into cozy domesticity : baking bread , reading books , taking long baths . Others have begun to fray : FaceTiming with friends is a necessity , not a luxury ; the closure of a favorite coffee shop is cause for tears ; the walls seem to be closing in . Be kind to your local extroverts . They 're having a hard time . <p> Still , no matter how hygge you 're feeling at this moment , experts suggest that the negative feelings and experiences associated with prolonged isolation will come for us all . Humans are social creatures -- yes , all of us . While the coronavirus pandemic is an extreme , largely unprecedented moment , the kind of seclusion that 's been eating at people over the last few weeks is not as uncommon an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation on our bodies and minds have been felt and studied in a variety of different groups , from astronauts to incarcerated people to immunocompromised children to Antarctic researchers to the elderly . The patterns that have emerged from their experiences with radical aloneness illuminate ways to understand and improve your own . <p> First off , it 's important to remember that isolation does n't just numb your brain with boredom . \" People start getting lethargic when they do n't have positive inputs into their small worlds , \" says John Vincent , a clinical psychologist at the University of Houston . \" We can expect depression to kick in , and depression and anxiety are kissing cousins . \" These symptoms are likely to be particularly intense during coronavirus-related isolation , according to Lawrence Palinkas , who researches psychosocial adaptation to extreme environments at the University of Southern California . \" Oftentimes , if you have a very well defined period of time in which you 're isolated people do pretty well up until the halfway point , \" Palinkas says . \" Then they experience a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we are now , when you 're not certain how long you 'll be asked to maintain social distance , that produces anxiety as well . \" <p> When people , like those kept in solitary confinement or scientists working in a remote region , know their sentence is nearly up , their mood lifts again in anticipation . Those practicing social distancing due to Covid-19 may not get that any time soon . \" Open , transparent , consistent communication is the most important thing governments and organizations can do : Make sure people understand why they are being quarantined first and foremost , how long it is expected to last , \" says Samantha Brooks , who has studied the psychological impact of quarantine at King 's College London . \" A huge factor in the negative psychological impact seems to be confusion about what 's going on , not having clear guidelines , or getting different messages from different organizations . \" So far , many governments , including the United States ' , have n't been heeding this advice . <p> Perhaps even more concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Harry Taylor , who studies social isolation in older adults , particularly in the black community , says that it 's one of the worst things that humans can do to their overall well-being , adding that \" the mortality effect of social isolation is like smoking 15 cigarettes per day . \" In older people , social isolation seems to exacerbate any preexisting medical conditions , from cardiovascular diseases to Alzheimer 's , but its ill effects are n't limited to those over 60 . <p> Alexander Chouker , a physician researcher who studies stress immunology at the University of Munich , has seen radical changes in the bodies of people participating in simulations of manned spaceflight missions like Mars-500 . \" They were young and trained people not in a condition of real threat , \" he says . \" The pure fact of being confined affects the body . If you change your environment in a quite extreme way , it is changing you . \" Participants , some of whom were only isolated for three months , experienced changes to their sleep , changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alterations to their metabolisms . \" Being confined and isolated affects the human physiology as a whole , \" Chouker says . <p> Does this mean your body will go wonky like an astronaut trapped on fake Mars for over a year ? Not necessarily . You probably are n't truly socially isolated , at least not to that extreme degree . And even those who study the negative consequences of social isolation still think practicing social distancing is a good idea . \" Covid-19 is flipping everything on its head , \" Taylor says . \" This is the first time since we have been alive that actively practicing social isolation is a method to improve health . \" <p> The people who are most at risk from the isolation associated with Covid-19 are the people who are at heightened risk of social isolation in the first place . \" Among older adults , lower income people and men experience isolation at a different level , \" says Thomas Cudjoe , a geriatrician researching the intersection of social connections and aging at Johns Hopkins University . ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inclination to develop social ties outside of work creates the disparity between those groups and their female or higher income counterparts . ) Taylor points out that anyone who is marginalized is more likely to have a more limited social network , whether they are a member of the LGBTQ+ community , a survivor of domestic abuse , or just live in a more isolated rural area . <p> These people may not have friends or family to call , or may be unable to do so . \" Some people have posited technology as a means of connecting people , but lower income groups might not even have FaceTime or Skype or minutes on their phone , \" Cudjoe says . \" People take that for granted , using their devices can be a strain on people 's incomes . \" Particularly if Covid-19 has left them out of a job . \" Minority bodies are going to be hit particularly hard because they often work in service industries , which increases risk for social isolation and loneliness and coronavirus , \" says Taylor . \" It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No matter what your unique situation is , there are many things you can do to improve your experience while being socially isolated . Chouker and others recommend exercise as a mood boost . \" Create as much structure and predictability as you can with the pieces of your life that you do have control over , \" Vincent says . Pursue neglected projects , get on with life , but also be patient with yourself -- both now and when this strange time eventually ends . People who go through a period of isolation , whether they 've been on the International Space Station or in quarantine , often experience PTSD symptoms and struggle while reintegrating back into their ordinary routine . Social isolation may gradually become your normal , and losing it may still be a jolt . <p> Fortunately , you 're not in this alone , and you should n't leave others that way , either . \" For the general public who are not isolated , think about those people who were in your network that you have n't heard from in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \" Cudjoe says . \" Strengthen those weak connections . \" With any luck , you 'll emerge from social distancing a whole lot closer . <p> Emma Grey Ellis is a staff writer at WIRED , specializing in internet culture and propaganda , as well as writing about planetary science and other things space-related .

( Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) <p> An immunology and molecular biologist pioneer who grew up here and now works in California hailed the news that some of the sickest Covid-19 patients at local hospitals began receiving an experimental treatment led by a researcher from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center . <p> \" Nice to see Buffalo on the cutting edge , \" said Andy Blidy , who grew up on the West Side and in Evans . <p> Blidy voiced great hopes for the trial , in which health providers at three hospitals will administer sarilumab , a monoclonal antibody against a protein that can worsen symptoms for those whose novel coronavirus has reached the critical stage in the ICU . <p> He moved to Boston in the 1980s to do graduate work at Tufts Medical School with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco region , diagnostics for HIV at BD Monoclonal Center and Applied Biosystems on the Human Genome Project . <p> Sarilumab and tocilizumab are both biologic medications given by injection to dial back inflammation for those with rheumatoid arthritis , easing swelling and joint pain . <p> They do so by supressing the free flow of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , a protein that in the lungs can supercharge inflammation and dramatically lower oxygen levels for the sickest of Covid-19 patients . <p> Dr. Igor Puzanov , director of the Early Phase Clinical Trials Program and chief of melanoma services at Roswell Park , leads the new trial . He works extensively with tocilizumab . <p> \" Some of the ways that Covid-19 affects the body are similar to how cancer and autoimmune conditions affect the body , so we can draw on what we know from those fields to address the pressing challenge of how best to treat the novel coronavirus , \" he said . <p> The two medications are among dozens of treatments made from antibodies that researchers around the world are using to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest drug companies are involved in the effort .

Patients sometimes also require paralytic drugs to loosen up their vocal cords and other muscles to prevent damage when the breathing tube is inserted . <p> Patients continue to receive sedatives and pain relievers to keep them asleep while intubated , to prevent their bodies from fighting against both the breathing tube and the ventilator , which performs breathing functions for patients to allow their own lungs to heal . <p> With many COVID-19 patients requiring ventilators for weeks , some health officials are worried that the nation 's supply of necessary drugs wo n't be enough to help the country weather a prolonged and sustained outbreak across multiple cities and states . <p> Dr. Erin Fox , who tracks and investigates drug shortages reported from hospitals around the country , told ABC News that some of the most commonly used drugs to intubate and maintain a patient on ventilator are running in short supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way , and we do n't see a tsunami of drug availability coming our way . It 's scary to think , you might not have enough medicine , \" she said . <p> Three of the drugs reportedly in short supply , according to Fox , are the sedative etomidate , an anesthetic ketamine and a muscle-relaxing medication called rocuronium . Several hospitals with whom ABC News spoke said they were running low on the critical medications . <p> Medical supplies for COVID-19 testing are pictured at the Summit Community Care Clinic in Frisco , Colo. , March 30 , 2020 . <p> While doctors and hospitals have the ability to use alternative drugs in some cases to help intubate and sedate patients , experts worry that a prolonged worldwide outbreak could severely stretch the global pharmaceutical supply chain , forcing countries to fight among one another for resources as several states have been forced to do for protective equipment in the U.S. <p> The American Society of Health System Pharmacists runs the database that monitors drug shortages reported from their 55,000 members across the country who work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in hot spots , but nationwide . <p> \" With all this surge capacity that 's being built , do we have the drug supply to match it ? Right now the answer appears to be ' no , ' \" said Dr. Michael Ganio , a senior director with the society . <p> At one health system that runs over 40 hospitals in Ohio and Virginia , a pharmacy director told ABC News they are starting to see shortages in medications used to sedate patients who are ventilated . Their pharmacy team is already coming up with contingency plans for when the preferred drugs run out . <p> \" The problem is , we 're all using the same manufacturers and same wholesalers .

But Bloomberg dropped out after a poor showing on Super Tuesday , and he has since fired staffers in multiple waves . His campaign had announced earlier in March that it would launch an independent expenditure group to take on Trump that would employ former campaign staffers in swing states . <p> Instead of creating his own organization in swing states , Bloomberg 's campaign said on Friday , he will donate $18 million to the Democratic National Committee -- allowing the party to potentially hire organizers themselves . <p> That means many Bloomberg organizers are out of a job .

And we will assist the DNC as much as we are able to , including by providing names of staff and working to help them onboard and grow their program as expediently as possible . \" <p> Staffers in swing states learned they were being let go on a call on Friday morning by campaign states director Dan Kanninen and human resources representative Katherine Sayers .

Sayers , the HR representative , told them to fill out a Google Form no later than March 25 , even if they had \" previously noted interest in future opportunities as part of your off-boarding last week . \" <p> The Google Form will not guarantee Bloomberg staffers a job with the DNC .

The world 's appetite for energy has been massively hit since the outbreak of novel coronavirus . With 3 billion people in lockdown , International Energy Agency ( IEA ) reckons global oil demand will witness a drop of 20% in the near future . Further , the fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia has resulted in a supply glut of crude oil and sparked off a relentless price war , depressing prices further and hurting the global energy industry . <p> Top oil and gas giants offer stable dividend payouts , a strategy to maintain the appeal of the stock among investors . However , as the world fights a pandemic , top energy companies will have to reassess their payout strategies , either by slowing down share buybacks or reintroducing non-cash dividends . <p> Re-modelling of Strategies a Pressing Priority <p> Many oil companies had cut expenses during the 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including booming U.S. shale oil production and shifting OPEC policies . Oil majors like TOTAL S.A. TOT and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A issued scrip dividends after the last slump , which enabled them to issue dividends in the form of shares rather than cash . <p> Let 's see how these companies are dealing with the oil downturn this time around . <p> The latest fall in crude has led several oil giants to slash their 2020 spending plans . Supermajors like Shell , TOTAL and Chevron CVX have rationalized their planned capital budgeting for the current year to weather the crisis . <p> Shell plans to trim its 2020 capital spending by a minimum of $5 billion from the past projection of $25 billion to $20 billion along with material reductions in working capital . It further plans to cut operating costs by $3-$4 billion over the next 12 months . Shell has also suspended its $25-billion share buyback plan . <p> TOTAL has decided to lower its 2020 capital expenditure guidance by nearly 20% to less than $15 billion from the prior $18 billion . <p> Chevron has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and aims to lower its run-rate operating costs in excess of $1 billion by this year-end . It has also suspended its $5-billion share repurchase program to weather the weak crude pricing scenario . <p> Italian energy firm Eni E has downwardly revised its 2020 capital budget by roughly ? 2 billion , representing 25% of its total budget . The Zacks Rank #3 ( Hold ) company has also decided to cut operating expenditure for 2020 by almost ? 400 million . Earlier this month , it even rolled back its ? 400 million stock repurchases plan.You can see the complete list of today 's Zacks #1 Rank ( Strong Buy ) stocks here . <p> Equinor ASA EQNR has revised its capital budget this year to $8.5 billion from the earlier $10-$11 billion . <p> With the above measures , the companies are expecting to balance their books , generate enough free cash flow and put a check on escalating debt levels . But none of them have announced dividend cuts yet . Morgan Stanley reckons oil majors ' debt level will rise too high by 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve as expected , we think European majors will start to reduce dividends in the second half of 2020 , \" says Martijn Rats , Morgan Stanley analyst . <p> Conclusion <p> The market has had to deal with twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic paralysing global energy demand and the unexpected oil price war that erupted between producers Russia and Saudi Arabia earlier this month . Oil majors have time and again expressed their reluctance to cut dividends in order to retain investor interest in the sector , which has suffered a setback due to concerns of long-term sustainability as the world seeks to curtail its use of fossil fuel . The top five oil majors-Chevron , TOTAL , BP plc BP , ExxonMobil XOM and Shell-added a combined $25 billion to debt levels in 2019 to sustain capital spending and return huge amounts to shareholders . <p> Although we expect the companies to be able to sustain their payout in at least 2020 , in order to sustain it , they will have to review their costs and deepen operational and capital expenditure cuts . If energy giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to debt . <p> Oil markets have experienced significant volatility and price declines amid concerns over the economic effects of coronavirus . However , oversupply of oil and slack in demand should not last forever , and once the economy regains momentum , the question to cut dividend payouts will hopefully not arise . Yet , the question on the affordability of such generous returns due to high levels of debt and growing crisis remains pertinent . <p> Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020 <p> In addition to the stocks discussed above , would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2020 ? <p> Last year 's 2019 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio returned gains as high as +102.7% .

Anthony Lanzilote for The New York Times <p> They hoped to secure jobs on political campaigns , at fashion brands and law offices , and in sales and finance . Instead , they 've had internships canceled and interviews postponed , wandered through empty job fairs and seen recruiters ignore their anxious emails . <p> When the coronavirus pandemic forced college students across the country to leave campus in early March , the abrupt departure was especially painful for seniors . It meant rushed goodbyes , canceled graduation ceremonies -- an overwhelming sense of loss . <p> Now , many of those seniors are home with their families , contemplating an even worse prospect : a job market more grim than any in recent history . Last week , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits , more than quadruple the previous record . <p> As the economy barrels toward a recession , college seniors fear they could become the next class of 2009 , which entered the work force at the peak of the Great Recession as companies conducted mass layoffs and froze hiring . <p> \" That is definitely on everyone 's minds , \" said Tarek Ziad , a senior at Yale studying ecology and evolutionary biology . \" We have to hike up our boots . \" <p> A number of major companies , including Yelp and Disney , have suspended their internship programs , a common route to a first job for many graduating seniors . At some job fairs in early March , major companies simply did n't show up ; now all those career events have been canceled . <p> The number of new job listings posted between mid-February and mid-March dropped 29 percent compared with the same period last year , according to data from the job marketplace ZipRecruiter .

Practically everyone he knows is anxious about the job market . Some of his roommates are Peace Corps recruits who do n't know whether they 'll be able to leave the country . His girlfriend is a dancer whose professional auditions have been canceled . <p> For his part , Mr. Salerno had hoped to get a job on a political campaign in his home state of Texas -- an option that no longer seems viable as canvassing has ground to a halt . <p> \" Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's upended , \" he said . \" I had a loose idea of what I was doing in a few months . And now I 'm just looking into the void . \" <p> For three years in a row , Isabel Serrano applied for an internship at the same New York lobbying firm , starting when she was a sophomore at New York University . She finally got it last year and started working in January as she finished her last semester at N.Y.U. She hoped it would turn into a job after graduation in May . <p> But a couple of weeks ago , as she took a walk in her parents ' neighborhood in Union County , N.J. , Ms. Serrano got an upsetting phone call : the internship was canceled because of the coronavirus . <p> \" It 's just a sad thing to hear , \" she said . \" I had two more months left to really advocate for myself and that is gone now . \" <h> A decade or more of ' scarring ' <p> Historically , college students who graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestigious companies than people who finished college even a year earlier .

But it does n't look good . <p> \" I 'm worried for them , \" said Lisa Kahn , an economist who has studied how recessions affect college graduates . \" If they 're graduating into a large recession , they 're going to suffer some pretty severe short-term consequences .

Kerin Borland , the director of the University of Michigan Career Center , said recruiters have continued to interview students over video chat . The school also turned an in-person job fair into a digital one through a partnership with CareerEco , a virtual recruiting platform . And Ms. Borland said she has encouraged undergraduates to keep in touch with recruiters so they are in the pipeline for future jobs . <p> \" The hope is we will get through this unusual circumstance and move forward , \" Ms. Borland said . \" Employers do n't want to have to start from scratch in terms of building relationships with students . \" <p> Some industries , like nursing , have even seen an increase in job listings , according to ZipRecruiter . The number of e-commerce listings rose 228 percent over the past four weeks compared to last year .

But given the pandemic , she has decided to pursue jobs in public health -- her minor at the University of Florida . \" Now more than ever I can use that part of my college degree to hop on something that 's so prevalent right now , \" she said . <h> All the standard moves are useless <p> Over the last few weeks , many job-hunting seniors have engaged in an awkward dance with recruiters in industries like law , journalism and technology , asking for updates while trying not to seem insensitive or selfish . All the traditional rules of engagement in a job hunt suddenly feel irrelevant . A meet-up for coffee is out of the question . A request for a networking call might seem invasive . <p> Kaylie Ramirez , a senior at Boston College , said she spoke with several recruiters in recent days to discuss job opportunities in financial and strategic communications . One said he empathized with Ms. Ramirez , noting that he graduated in 2009 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as helpful as he could . But others advised her to hold off on sending her r ? sum ? given the uncertainty . <p> \" It was a reality check , \" Ms. Ramirez said . \" I 've gradually been lowering my expectations , and I think that confirmed what I knew deep down , anyway . \" <p> For some seniors , uncertainty about the economy has created outrage . Most of them were in fifth grade in 2008 . But they remember the damage wrought by the Great Recession . <p> \" It 's hard to be motivated or excited about the systems we have in place because we 've seen the mess they 've created over and over again , \" said Ms. Serrano , the senior at N.Y.U. <p> But memories of 2008 -- and the economy 's eventual recovery -- have also been a source of comfort . <p> \" This is the first pandemic that I have lived through , that my parents have lived through , but this is n't the first time the economy has not been great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . \" If we can get through the recession in 2008 , I think we can get through this . \" <h> Answers to Your Frequently Asked Questions <p> Updated March 24 , 2020 <h> How does coronavirus spread ? <p> It seems to spread very easily from person to person , especially in homes , hospitals and other confined spaces . The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out . It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face . <h> What makes this outbreak so different ? <p> Unlike the flu , there is no known treatment or vaccine , and little is known about this particular virus so far . It seems to be more lethal than the flu , but the numbers are still uncertain . And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard . <h> What should I do if I feel sick ? <p> If you 've been exposed to the coronavirus or think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cough or difficulty breathing , call a doctor . They should give you advice on whether you should be tested , how to get tested , and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others . <h> What if somebody in my family gets sick ? <p> If the family member does n't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home , you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms , while also keeping as much distance as possible , according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there 's space , the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom . If masks are available , both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room . Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters , doorknobs , toilets and tables . Do n't forget to wash your hands frequently . <h> Should I wear a mask ? <p> Experts are divided on how much protection a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for people who are n't yet sick . The W.H.O. and C.D.C. say that unless you 're already sick , or caring for someone who is , wearing a face mask is n't necessary . The New York Times and other news outlets have been reporting that the wearing of face masks may not help healthy people , noting that while masks can help prevent the spread of a virus if you are infected , most surgical masks are too loose to prevent inhalation of the virus and the more effective N95 masks , because of shortages at health centers worldwide , should be used only by medical personnel . But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic . And a few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded places where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people . Masks do n't replace hand-washing and social distancing . <h> Should I stock up on groceries ? <p> Plan two weeks of meals if possible . But people should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supply chain remains strong . And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home . <h> Should I pull my money from the markets ? <p> That 's not a good idea . Even if you 're retired , having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation , or even grows , makes sense . But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year 's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years . |\n",

      "|@@31759041 <h> John Ball Zoo feeling the strain of coronavirus closure <p> GRAND RAPIDS , MI -- John Ball Zoo officials are concerned about the lasting impact of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic . <p> The zoo , located at 1300 W. Fulton St. , was supposed to open April 3 , but has been closed indefinitely due to concerns about the respiratory disease spreading . <p> But John Ball Zoo has nearly 2,000 animals to feed and take care of . <p> \" We still have mouths , snouts , beaks , and jaws to feed and care for , \" said Peter D'Arienzo , CEO of the John Ball Zoo . <p> \" Our animal care team , veterinarians , and essential facilities crew all remain on grounds to maintain the excellent care that we provide each and every day of the year , while practicing social distancing to keep one another healthy . \" <p> The zoo estimates that it will lose about $1 million each month that it remains closed due to lack of income from admissions , events , experiences , sponsorships , donations , and food and retail sales . <p> Officials say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April through early December . <p> To make up for the hit , the zoo has already put off seasonal hiring and facility improvement projects . They 've also canceled some camps and educational programs . <p> \" The John Ball Zoo family of employees and the broader community is at the center of what we do , and limiting the opportunities available to them is the last thing we want to do , \" said D'Arienzo . <p> \" People love the zoo and we will welcome them back to help us rebuild when we are able to do so . \" <p> The zoo is hoping that as the closure remains in effect , the community will help pitch in . They 're asking people to renew or purchase a zoo membership for themselves or as a gift . <p> People can also donate directly to the Zoo 's Annual Operating Fund , adopt an animal and make plans to visit when the Zoo reopens , the zoo said in a statement . <p> The zoo has had to make some major changes in order to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other safety measures are being taken . <p> They 've sent home all volunteers and now full-time employees have to fill in those gaps . That means the full-time employees are working outside of their usual duties . <p> For example , volunteer divers used to clean the kelp tank , now animal teams who happen to be certified divers have taken on that duty . It 's been a challenge , D'Arienzo said in a statement . <p> Some of the jobs at the zoo are very specialized - like caring for the red pandas or an Amur tiger . <p> \" Everyone is pitching in . None of us have experienced a time like this . We will get through this just as we always do during tough times ; by working together to take care of each other , \" said D'Arienzo.

We 're being told , ' You need this kind of equipment ' and I have no idea what 's going to come in the next couple weeks . <p> \" It is so intense . Not a lot of people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all going to be learning together . \" <p> Fonfara , who has yet to directly work with a Covid-19 patient , reassures herself by leaning on her medical training , which is paramount . She also considers what she learned as a high school , college and professional hockey player . <p> \" Everyone 's got to work together to accomplish a goal , \" said Fonfara , an Elma resident who played for the Beauts in 2018-19 . \" That 's what I 've learned from playing sports , all my life , and being on a team and in a level of unity on my floor . \" <p> Fonfara is one of the medical professionals who were college or pro athletes in Western New York who are helping the fight against a public health crisis . <p> Zach Ahart , former UB cross country runner , is now a resident in Cincinnati ( Harry Scull Jr. /Buffalo News file photo ) <p> In Cincinnati , former UB runner Zach Ahart is in his first year of residency in internal medicine . <p> \" I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahart , a former Mid-American Conference cross country champion and a Starpoint graduate . \" As a resident , I do n't work in an emergency room , but if an ER resident feels a patient needs to be admitted , we go to the emergency room , examine a patient and admit them . \" <p> In Philadelphia , Kim Dale is an intensive care nurse who works in outpatient neurology . The former University at Buffalo swimmer has been told that she could return a hospital intensive care unit soon . <p> \" Some days , I have a little bit of anxiety about it , and some days , I know I have the training for it , and I 'm not at all surprised I 'd be asked to go back in , \" said Dale , a 2010 UB graduate . \" Going into nursing , you expect to take care of people in all types of situations . <p> \" A pandemic never crossed my mind when I was training to be a nurse . Other disasters and whatnot cross your mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fonfara had a full nursing schedule in addition to playing hockey in her only professional season with the Beauts . She played high school hockey for Lancaster/Iroquois/Depew and played at Elmira College . <p> \" Playing hockey with the Beauts and being a nurse was not easy , \" Fonfara said . \" But everything leading up to today prepared me for this . \" <h> The team approach <p> Dale considered the emphasis on preparation as an athlete , the hours of practice that allowed her to compete in a swim meet . As she awaits word on if and when she will go into an ICU , she has reviewed protocols that have been put in place for ICU nursing , and the treatments , and reviewing ICU work she has already done . <p> \" One thing we were taught was that the No. 1 thing you can do to be ready for competition is to be prepared , to put the training in , \" Dale said . \" Put everything into place and what you can control to get the best outcome . \" <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure situations , but instead of being the player who handles the puck with the game on the line , Fonfara is part of a medical team that negotiates life-or-death scenarios . <p> \" In scary situations , like now , when it comes down to the last minute of a game , you have to be calm and collected , just like now , \" Fonfara said . \" You ca n't freak out . You have to do what you can and what is in your control . That 's what hockey taught me and that 's what sports taught me . When we have a rapid response , I find myself handling it well . You ca n't freak out , or everyone else around you is going to freak out . \" <p> Christian Muller , a former UB swimmer , is a resident doctor with a family medicine practice in New Jersey . He leans on his time-management skills and his ability to self-accommodate in order to navigate a public health crisis . <p> \" It 's an ever-changing world right now , \" said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a race , you need to learn how to adapt . In swimming , you think about what you 're doing in practice versus what you 're doing in competition . If something goes wrong you say , ' okay , I need to change what I am doing to keep this on track and to get better . ' <p> \" In this case , it 's to ensure the safety of the public . \" <h> Preparing for a crisis <p> Shant ? White is an anesthesiology resident physician in Rochester , and she is a former MAC champion in the hammer throw at UB . She has a smaller case load now that many elective surgeries have been canceled , but is preparing to work in the ICU if there is an increase in Covid-19 cases in Rochester requires that level of care . <p> \" I ca n't say if we 're prepared or underprepared , but as soon as all of this started happening , the chief resident and our attendings did a really good job at giving us direction of how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our patients safe , \" said Moore , a 2012 UB graduate . \" It would be unfair to say we 're underprepared , because we are not . We 're making the best of the resources we have , and we 're doing that . We are having a positive , proactive response to it . <p> \" We 're coming together , and we 're trying to figure out the best way to keep ourselves safe while taking care of patients . \" <p> Ahart admits that by some measure , there is some fear that comes in working in medicine during a public health crisis . He 's seen what 's happened in other countries , and has heard many stories of health-care workers becoming ill . <p> \" But it 's our job , \" Ahart said . \" We do what we 've got to do , and we try to stay as healthy as possible . \" <h> Advice for others <p> \" And try to live your best life , \" Ahart said . \" Do n't go stir crazy . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news , but our practices so far , based on what scientists are telling us , it sounds like we 've already made quite an impact on the spread of things . And keep this up . \" <p> Dale is now an avid runner and a triathlete , and she emphasizes cultivating positivity . <p> \" Take an hour or two out of the day to be by yourself , find a way to meditate and get back in the zone , \" Dale said . \" If you find something to escape for an hour or two , and get away from the negative news , things get better . \" <p> Like Ahart , White reiterates much of the clinical advice that 's being emphasized . But she also takes the team-first approach in the fight against the pandemic . <p> \" Support each other , \" White said . \" Realize that the doctors on the front line are the best to take care of these patients , and the best thing for you to do is to do the things that will help prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a college/high school sports enterprise reporter at The Buffalo News .
